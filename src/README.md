# Building

To build, run the following in the command line:

```
npm i
npm run build
```

This will run the build.js file, which will do the following:

* Transform the JavaScript files to create versions that work with Node.
* Copy the original JavaScript files into the /docs/ folder (so they can be used by the examples and tutorial).
