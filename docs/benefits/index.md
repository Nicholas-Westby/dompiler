# Why Should I Use Dompiler?

Here are some of the benefits:

* **HTML Templating** It makes rendering HTML in JavaScript really straightforward (it leans heavily on a JavaScript feature called "template literals" to do so).
* **Size** It's tiny; like, really tiny. Once minified and compressed with gzip, it's 1KB (1,082 bytes at last check).
* **Speed** It uses the browser's native HTML parsing capabilities, so it's blazingly fast. The small size also means the browser can parse the library itself very fast.
* **Documented** It has a number of examples and an extensive tutorial. The code is also well commented.
* **Simple** With fewer than a dozen functions to learn, it's extremely simple.
* **Flexible** You can use it directly in the browser or via NPM.
* **Low Maintenance** Since Dompiler is just using plain JavaScript (and a small amount at that), there is little risk of this library growing stale. Understanding it in order to contribute (e.g., a bug fix) is very easy.
